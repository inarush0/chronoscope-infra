/**
 * Spreads coincident low-precision dates across the period they assert.
 *
 * Most authored dates carry a year and nothing more ("30 AD"), so every event
 * in that year resolves to the same millisecond — 89 of them land on 30-01-01.
 * Events at an identical timestamp cannot be told apart by the timeline no
 * matter how far it zooms: they stay one density bar forever, and nothing in
 * that bar can be hovered, selected, or inspected.
 *
 * So each group of events sharing a resolved timestamp is distributed evenly
 * across the calendar period its precision covers — a "30 AD" event may land
 * anywhere within 30 AD, a "30-04 AD" event anywhere within April. The offsets
 * are for layout only. They stay inside the interval the authored date already
 * asserts, so no displayed year or month changes, and day-precision dates
 * assert an exact day and never move.
 *
 * Order within a group is canonical book order, then the order the events are
 * written in the file, which is narrative order.
